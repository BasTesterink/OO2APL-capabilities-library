# OO2APL-capabilities-library
Capabilities in OO2APL are intended to be easily-reusable modules of functionalities for agents. This repository collects them (rather than having one repository for each capability). If you have developed a reusable capability then please submit it so that other agent programmers do not have to re-invent the wheel.
